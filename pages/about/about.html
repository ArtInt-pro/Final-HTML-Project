<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>

<p>
    My name is Enwọñọ Ntuk. I am 20 years old, and I currently study at the College of Health Science, Uyo. I am a software programmer, and I'm interested in python, javascript, typescript, next.js, react.js,
    react-native, tailwind CSS, firebase.js, and node. js. When I'm not coding, I study, reasearch, engage in sports activities, or play a little of video games. With my skills, I hope to bring useful and groundbreaking innovations to the health sector through technology.
